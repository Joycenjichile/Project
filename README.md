# Inspiration
#### “Sometimes money cannot save life but donated blood can!”
A cancer patient is in a hospital and needs blood urgently but the relatives are far.Therefore it is impossible for the relatives to come and donate blood, how can we help such patients access a timely supply of blood in order to save lives?
The difficulties that blood donor organizations face in connecting blood donors and available blood appeals, particularly in times of emergency, are incredibly exhausting. This has inspired us to develop a management system that assists blood donor organizations in improving the donor management process in order to determine eligibility more efficiently.

# Problem

#### “Sometimes money cannot save life but donated blood can!”
The direct contact donor and the recipient is not offered by many of the blood banks.This is critical when there is an emergency in need of blood.

This has inspired us to develop a management system that assists blood donor organizations in improving the donor management process in order to determine eligibility more efficiently.
